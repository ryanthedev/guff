# guff
## logging the 12 factor way
---

treat logs like *structured* events.  

### what is guff?
.net core library to handle the *consumption*, *mutation*, and *delivery* of events that happen in your system.

### another one?
yeah, the current solutions were designed when structured logging wasn't a thing.  I'm tired of shoving a square peg into a circle hole.

### why should I choose this?
speed, simplicity, and *value*.  if you don't what value is, it's the thing that helps you make decisions when you have a question.
